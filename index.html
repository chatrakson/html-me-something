                        My wife and I traveled to Japan for our honeymoon.
                        It remains are favorite place to travel and every year, we have a tough decision picking another country to travel to.
                        We always want to travel back to Japan as it was the safest, cleanest, and friendliest place we've been to.

                        My wife and I traveled to Italy with our friends. It was their first time out of the country and first time on a plane all in one trip!
                        We had a lot of fun looking at old buildings and eating delicious fod.

                        This is on the same trip as Italy. It was right across the pond. Just touring where they filmed Game of Throne's King's Landing.
